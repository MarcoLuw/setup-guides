# Knowledge Boosting
An island for many wonderful things in my devops and cloud engineering journey. <br />
Here you can find various setup guides, architecture design thoughts, and best practices that I've gathered over my development journey. <br />

Main sections in this repository:
1. **[Projects and Experiments](#projects-and-experiments)**: Interesting projects I've worked or been working on, showcasing the practical application and best practices of various technologies.
2. **[Setup Guides](#setup-guides):** Step-by-step instructions for setting up various tools and services
3. **[Workshops](#workshops):** Materials and resources from seminars, talks, or workshops I've conducted.
4. **[General Knowledge](#general-knowledge):** Quick note for different concepts, technologies in various domains.

### Future Plans
Since this is a growing repository, I plan to add more not only instructions and architecture design patterns, but also interesting insights and experiences in other areas. **Stay tuned for updates!**
